# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
In creating this program, I sought to learn how to interpret data better. I decided to do this with the use of the R programming language, which was designed to organize and manipulate sets of data.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the R language.}
The software that I created is a simple movie data analysis tool. Essentially, it takes a set of movie data and interprets it to show different trends in movies and movie reviews. For example, with this software, I was able to determine from the data the highest and lowest reviewed movies of the past 100 years, the most and least popular movies, the movies that were most popular in each decade, what the most common movie rating number is, etc.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
My purpose in writing this software was twofold: 1. To learn a new language, namely R, which would help me better understand data manipulation, and 2. To learn more about trends in movies, since I am a movie fan.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- VSCode
- R extension for VSCode
- R syntax extension for VSCode
- Rainbow CSV
- MovieLens movie database from GroupLens

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used the R language, as well as the libraries "languageserver" and "radian", for easier use of R.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Make an easier system of running the program in the terminal; as of now, I have to call the exact path of my R installation in order to get the program to run.
- Make the program more interactive, by allowing a user to input data about their favorite movies and have the program output some recommendations for them.
- Make the program more visual.
