# Overview

In creating this program, I sought to learn how to interpret data better. I decided to do this with the use of the R programming language, which was designed to organize and manipulate sets of data.

The software that I created is a simple movie data analysis tool. Essentially, it takes a set of movie data and interprets it to show different trends in movies and movie reviews. For example, with this software, I was able to determine from the data the highest and lowest reviewed movies of the past 100 years, the most and least popular movies, the movies that were most popular in each decade, what the most common movie rating number is, etc.

My purpose in writing this software was twofold: 1. To learn a new language, namely R, which would help me better understand data manipulation, and 2. To learn more about trends in movies, since I am a movie fan.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- VSCode
- R extension for VSCode
- R syntax extension for VSCode
- languageserver
- radian
- Rainbow CSV
- MovieLens movie database from GroupLens

I used the R language, as well as the libraries "dplyr" and "ggplot2", for easier use of R.

# Future Work

- Make an easier system of running the program in the terminal; as of now, I have to call the exact path of my R installation in order to get the program to run.
- Make the program more interactive, by allowing a user to input data about their favorite movies and have the program output some recommendations for them.
- Make the program more visual.
